## Case 1.

### Requirements

- one large Amazon EC2 instance with attached EBS volumes to store all data.
- system accepts the information from the user including documents and photos
- and then performs automated verification and processing to check if the applicant is eligible
- The system becomes unavailable at times when there is a surge of applicants using the system. The - - attached EBS volumes are not enough to store the ever-growing data being uploaded by the users.

Which of the following options is the recommended option to achieve high availability and more scalable data storage?

### Solution

In this scenario, you need to overhaul the existing immigration service to upgrade its storage and computing capacity. Since EBS Volumes can only provide limited storage capacity and are not scalable, you should use S3 instead. The system goes down at times when there is a surge of requests which indicates that the existing large EC2 instance could not handle the requests any longer. In this case, you should implement a highly-available architecture and a queueing system with SQS and Auto Scaling.

Upgrade your architecture to use an S3 bucket with cross-region replication (CRR) enabled, as the storage service. Set up an SQS queue to distribute the tasks to a group of EC2 instances with Auto Scaling to dynamically increase or decrease the group of EC2 instances depending on the length of the SQS queue. Use CloudFormation to replicate your architecture to another region.

This option provides high availability and scalable data storage with S3. Auto-scaling of EC2 instances reduces the overall processing time and SQS helps in distributing the tasks to a group of EC2 instances.

### Odap Note

- EBS is not an easily scalable and durable storage solution compared to Amazon S3.
- Using SQS is more suitable in distributing the tasks to an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and not SNS.
- Having a large EBS volume attached to each of the EC2 instance of the auto-scaling group is not economical.
- It will be hard to sync the growing data across these EBS volumes. You should use S3 instead.

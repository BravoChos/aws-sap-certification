# Setting up the Production AWS Account

Follow the same steps to create a PRODUCTION AWS account as following.

- Create the AWS account named similar to your -GENERAL account but -PRODUCTION
- Add MFA to the account root user (and test it!!)
- Enable billing access for IAM users and set account contacts
- Add a billing ALARM to the PRODUCTION AWS Account.
- Add a BUDGET to PRODUCTION AWS Account (remember the checkboxes)


`Useful Notes!`

Remember the `gmail '+'` thick!! (very useful)! This will allow you to use the '+' sign in an email address. And this will mean that you can generate an infinite number of unique email addresses which all go back to the same Gmail account.

*Tip
Create as alias for your account!! (feat. IAM Dashboard)
